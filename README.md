# c-collection

A C++ STL like lib. Using this lib could be so simple: just add some macros in the struct.
This design is inspired from the linux kernel list implementation. Of course, my impl is not
that perfect, but it is easy to use and, well enjoy it.

                           bugs report are warmly welcome, thanks. email:106601549@qq.com
